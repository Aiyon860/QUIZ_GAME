1. Which of the following operators is used for arithmetic addition?
a) +
b) *

d) &&

2. A collection of items where elements are added and removed from one specific end is called a:
a) Queue
b) Stack
c) Linked List
d) Array

3. In C, how do you declare a variable named age to store an integer value? 
a) int age = 0;
b) string age = "0";
c) age = int(0);
d) None of the above.

4. An array is a fixed-size, sequential collection of elements that can be accessed directly using an index. What operation has the fastest time complexity for accessing elements in an array? 
a) Insertion
b) Deletion
c) Access
d) Sorting

5. A while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. How can you write a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5? 
a) for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { ... }
b) do { ... } while (i <= 5);
c) All of the above are valid.
d) while (i <= 5) { ... }

6. What is the difference between a linear and non-linear data structure? 
a) Linear data structures can only store numbers, while non-linear data structures can store any data type.
b) Linear data structures have elements arranged in a specific order, while non-linear data structures do not.
c) Linear data structures are always stored in memory contiguously, while non-linear data structures are not.
d) None of the above.

7. How do you declare and initialize an array in C to store 10 characters? 
a) char myString[10];
b) char *myString = "Hello";
c) string myString = 10;
d) None of the above.

8. What are the common operations performed on an array (Choose all that apply)? 
a) Accessing elements.
b) Inserting elements at any position.
c) Deleting elements from any position.
d) Finding the size of the array.

9. What is a for loop and how is it used for iterating through an array? 
a) A for loop is an event-driven loop that executes until a specific event occurs.
b) A for loop allows you to iterate a specific number of times, often used to access elements in an array by index.
c) A for loop is similar to a while loop but with a simpler syntax.
d) None of the above.

10. Explain the concept of a linked list. 
a) A linked list is a data structure where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
b) A linked list is a non-linear data structure used to represent hierarchical relationships.
c) None of the above.
d) A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains data and a pointer to the next element in the list.
