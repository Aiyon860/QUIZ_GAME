1. Pointers to pointers are used for:
a) Dynamic memory allocation only.
b) Passing functions as arguments.
c) Multidimensional arrays.
d) None of the above.

2. A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. What is a collision in a hash table
a) When a key is not found in the table.
b) When two keys map to the same index.
c) When the hash table is full.
d) None of the above.

3. When dealing with memory management in C, it's important to avoid dangling pointers. What is a dangling pointer?
a) A pointer that has not been initialized.
b) A pointer that points to a constant variable.
c) None of the above.
d) A pointer that points to a memory location that has been freed.

4. A self-balancing binary search tree is a type of binary search tree that:
a) Maintains a balanced height difference between subtrees for efficient search and insertion.
b) Only allows insertion of unique values.
c) Performs faster searches on smaller datasets.
d) Is simpler to implement than a standard binary search tree.

5. What are some common applications of bit manipulation operations in C (e.g., shift operators, bitwise AND, OR, XOR)?
a) Extracting individual bits from a byte or integer.
b) Performing basic arithmetic operations more efficiently.
c) All of the above.
d) Manipulating flags and bit fields in memory.

6. Graphs are non-linear data structures used to represent relationships between objects. What are the different ways to represent a graph in C, except?
a) Adjacency matrix: A two-dimensional array where rows and columns represent vertices, and values indicate connections.
b) Adjacency list: An array of linked lists, where each linked list represents the neighbors of a specific vertex.
c) All of the above.
d) Tree: A hierarchical structure where nodes are connected by parent-child relationships.

7. Explain the concept of function pointers in C and how they can be used.
a) Function pointers are a way to pass functions as arguments to other functions.
b) Function pointers store the memory address of a function, allowing you to call functions directly.
c) Function pointers can be used to create generic functions that work with different data types.
d) All of the above.

8. Heaps are specialized tree-based structures used for priority queues. What are the two main types of heaps and their properties?
a) Min-heap: Priority is given to the element with the smallest value. Max-heap: Priority is given to the element with the largest value.
b) Balanced heap: Ensures balanced height for efficient operations. Unbalanced heap: Can be more efficient for insertions but may have uneven height.
c) Binary heap: Only allows two child nodes per parent. Fibonacci heap: Can have varying numbers of child nodes.
d) Static heap: Fixed size allocated at compile time. Dynamic heap: Resizes based on data at runtime.

9. Mention common strategies for handling memory errors in C programs.
a) Use assertions to check assumptions about program state and terminate if violated.
b) Perform input validation to ensure user-provided data is within expected ranges.
c) Employ error codes or return values to signal errors from functions.
d) All of the above.

10. Describe the concept of time and space complexity analysis in algorithms.
a) Time complexity measures the number of steps or operations an algorithm takes to execute as the input size grows.
b) Space complexity measures the amount of additional memory an algorithm requires besides the input data.
c) Both time and space complexity are analyzed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's resource usage.
d) All.
