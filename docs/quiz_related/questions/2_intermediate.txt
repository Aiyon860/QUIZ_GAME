1. A function can return a value to the calling code. What happens if a function doesn't explicitly return a value? 
a) The function crashes the program.
b) The function returns 0 by default.
c) The function returns a random value. 
d) The function continues to execute indefinitely.

2. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains: 
a) Data and pointers to both next and previous elements.
b) Data and a pointer to the previous element.
c) Data and a pointer to the next element.
d) Only data.

3. When you pass an array to a function in C, what is actually passed? 
a) A pointer to the first element of the array.
b) The entire array content is copied.
c) None of the above.
d) The size of the array.

4. A binary search tree is a sorted search tree that allows for efficient searching. What is the maximum number of child nodes a node can have in a binary search tree? 
a) 1
b) 3
c) Unlimited
d) 2

5. Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory during program execution using functions like malloc and free. What happens if you forget to call free on allocated memory? 
a) The program crashes.
b) The memory leak occurs, reducing available memory over time.
c) The allocated memory is automatically freed after the function exits.
d) None of the above.

6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a linked list compared to an array? (Choose all that apply) 
a) Linked lists are more flexible in size but slower for random access.
b) Arrays are easier to implement but have fixed size. 
c) Linked lists can store any data type, while arrays are limited to a single type.
d) Arrays are better for storing large amounts of data.

7. How can you reverse a string in C? (Choose all that apply) 
a) Use a built-in library function if available.
b) Recursively call a function to reverse a substring until the entire string is reversed. 
c) None of the above.
d) Use a loop to iterate through the string from the end to the beginning, copying characters to a new string in reverse order.

8. What is the concept of recursion in programming? 
a) A function that calls itself directly or indirectly.
b) A loop that iterates a set number of times.
c) A way to pass data between functions using arguments.
d) A method for sorting elements in an array.

9. When using malloc to allocate memory, what should you do to avoid memory leaks? 
a) Allocate memory only once at the beginning of the program.
b) Set the allocated memory pointer to NULL after use.
c) Use free on the allocated memory pointer when you are finished using it.
d) None of the above.

10. How does a binary search algorithm work in C? 
a) It iterates through the entire array, comparing each element to the target value.
b) It repeatedly divides the search space in half based on a comparison with the target value, eliminating half of the array at each step.
c) Doesn't require the array to be sorted beforehand.
d) It can only be used for searching arrays of integers.
